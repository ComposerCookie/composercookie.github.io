		<p>Oh boy! I have an about me page... What do I put here... Hi guys, thank you for checking me out in detail. I am a self taught programmer who had been programming since I was 12. Over 6 years, I had messed with a variety of programming topic, from C++ to PHP, from graphic libraries like SDL to SMFL. I think I am confident enough to work as whether a C#/Vb.NET programmer or a web developer; I am capable of designing OOP architecture in C#, building both front end and back end software and Microsoft Technologies. As for web, I have worked with popular libraries such as Ember and Angular, Phaser and PIXI, and multi-platform library like Cordova. Back when I was in high school, I went to Web Design/Development competitions by Virtual Enterprise International in which I won an almost perfect score (198/200), a honorable mention, a 2nd place and a 6th place over 3 different comepetitions against over 200 different schools in California. I am currently a freelancer at Fiverr (www.fiverr.com/jackiechar) in which I have excellent reviews and satisfied customers.
		<p> Aside from programming, I esteem myself in other video game design aspect like writing and pixel art. Most of my programming projects so far had been involved with video game in one way or another; It is my dream to create a video game as popular as Undertale and Final Fantasy and create a 2d MMORPG like Haven and Hearth. In my free time, I enjoy playing Awesomenaut, Empire Earth, Runescape and surf the web.

		<h1>Jackie's RPG Maker</h1>
		<h2>RPG Maker Clone...literally figuratively</h2>
		<br>
		<p> Developer: Jacqueline
		<p> C#, SFML, Dock Panel Suite
		<br>
		<p> Oh boy, one of my first massive project I ever created. Ever wanted to make your own game? Yeah this is it. The system was designed to be OOP heavy, and I mean it, OOP HEAVY. The whole system is made of base objects that was setted up to be polymorphed into other objects, which allow you to easily have database of similar but a bit different objects for things like Events, different functionals characters or buttons. It was a fun experience to create this, though if I came back to remake this, I will definitely aim for a better GUI and more stable foundation
		<br>
		<p> Implemented Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Create characters that are playable (though you can only play the first and there is no switching)</li>
			<li>Map, Map Editor, Map Animation</li>
			<li>Event System like RPG Maker</li>
			<li>Create/Save/Open game files.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Smite Team Management</h1>
		<h2>Allow you to be a Smite professional... hopefully</h2>
		<br>
		<p> Developer: Jacqueline
		<p> C#, SFML, Lidgren
		<br>
		<p> A more professional project created recently. I made it for a Smite team coach in Switzerland. This software allow you to set up a local server where your team can join and draw strategies... literally. This is a whiteboard software that come with chat (decently private, by that I mean there is no tracking, but there is no encryption neither). That's pretty much it really, you can choose different maps, draw/erase, set the sizes, dragging gods around, etc. On a personal note, Awesomenaut > Smite.
		<br>
		<p> Implemented Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Whiteboard, Draw/Erase over maps (and your friends can see it and draw with you, too)</li>
			<li>Host your own server with friend, come with password for protection in case stranger join</li>
			<li>Private chat, with whiteboard "privilege". Hoster can grant/take away whiteboard privilege</li>
			<li>Pick, arrange your Smite team, drag them around strategically</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Wandering Soul</h1>
		<h2>An offline Haven and Hearth wannabe</h2>
		<br>
		<p> Developer: Jacqueline
		<p> C#, SFML
		<br>
		<p> My most proud project I ever created, took me over 4 months to work on this. I was in love with a game called Haven and Hearth back then (still do, but I don't want to pay for the game now that a P2P/P2Win version came out). Definitely a project that I will come back later once I find the time. I spend a lot of time planning and designing this, though I was really disappointed that I was the only team member. The amount of work I had to do was overwhelming for a one person team. I did all the arts, all the designs, all the GUI, all the graphics, all the programming, etc. Though I think you should try it out, despite it's not finished. There are a lot of feature implemented (some of which I'm really is proud of). 
		<br>
		<p> Implemented Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Dynamic building setted up, you can make more building easily, but there is only one kind of building at the moment, and that's a bundle of wood (which you can actually lit it up)</li>
			<li>Dynamic environment, again, only trees are cuttable at the moment, but with very ltitle coding, you can create more things to destroy</li>
			<li>Autotile</li>
			<li>Pathfinding</li>
			<li>Basic AI</li>
			<li>Map Generator</li>
			<li>2 handed combat, inventory/equipment, multiple characters/party system</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Flashcard Quiz</h1>
		<h2>Yes I know there are better one on the market</h2>
		<br>
		<p> Developer: Jacqueline
		<p> C#, WinForm, PDF Sharp
		<br>
		<p> I made this during my SAT preps summer, because I didn't want to spend time studying the SAT. I do really well on math, but I just don't like doing English SAT stuff. Programming had more pull to me than SAT ever will do, so instead of creating flash card and memorize it, I just made a flashcard program instead. It was quite awesome actually, it took me like a week to code the program, and another weeks to add in vocabs words (manually) so that my friends can download it and print right away.  
		<br>
		<p> Implemented Features:
		<ul>
			<li>Word Database, add, remove your own words</li>
			<li>Manage your lists, learn a few word at time, create smaller lists out of your big list</li>
			<li>Print your words lists (make sure to use 2 sided printer)</li>
			<li>Quiz yourself, with multiple choices or fill in the blank</li>
