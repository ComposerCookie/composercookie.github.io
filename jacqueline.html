		<h3>My Programming Experience</h3>
		<ul class="pastProjects">
			<li class="left">
				<p class="proj-head">Wayward Sail</p>
				<span>Wayward Sail is an in-progress ORPG that I and my fiance Kevin is working on. It is being built with Typescript for front end and Python/Flask for back end.
					  This is one of the most difficult project that I have worked on and forced me to step out of my comfort zone to play with concepts, languages and library that
					  I was not familiar with. Please refer to <a href="http://ordrstudio.com/">[My Homepage]</a> for list of features that we plan to implement.
					  <ul>
						  <li>HTML/CSS overlay with rendered graphic from PIXI</li>
						  <li>OAuth, Subscriber-Publisher model</li>
						  <li>Postgres, JSON Serialization</li>
						  <li>Graphic artist, content development</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
				<img src="gfx/wayward2.png">
			</li>

			<li class="right">
				<p class="proj-head">CGen</p>
				<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/codegenerator">[Hackathon Submission]</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/CodeGenerator">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<img src="gfx/cgen.png">
				<span>This project is a 24 hours submission to HackPSU Spring 2017. While CGen is a step down in term of programming difficulty, it's a project that I'm realy proud
					  to share because this is a project where I took charge and lead a 5 members team. I was the only one in my team that have a lot of programming experiences,
					  so I had to coach my team and divide the work and make sure that we get things done by milestone. Overall despite having only 4 hours of sleep, it was a really
					  fun experience and something I think worth sharing.
					  <ul>
						  <li>Used GitHub for team collaboration and unit testing/integration</li>
						  <li>Agile/scrum to make sure the project was on time</li>
						  <li>Communication, pair programming and leadership</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
			</li>

			<li class="left">
				<p class="proj-head">Map Editor</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/GEMapEditor">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<span>This is an open source tile map system software that I originally made for Eclipse Origins before the community died. It is an improved map editor version of
					  Jackie's RPG Maker map engine with better layout and more features. I plan to use this editor to create static map for Wayward Sail.
					  <ul>
						  <li>2d Map Editor with dynamic tile sizing</li>
						  <li>Undo/Redo for multiple opened view</li>
						  <li>Weifenluo's Dock Panel, C#, SFML</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
				<img src="gfx/mapeditor.png">
			</li>

			<li class="right">
				<p class="proj-head">TeamSmiter</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/TeamSmiter">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<img src="gfx/teamsmiter.png">
				<span>TeamSmiter is composed Smite (the game) + Team (management). This is an open source whiteboard software that I created to allow users to formulate strategy and
					  manage your team for Smite. This was the first time I ever attempted to create a whiteboard software and I ended up learning a lot, not just programming, but also
					  math and geometry.
					  <ul>
						  <li>Lidgren network library for hosting/connecting to team server</li>
						  <li>Efficient whiteboard drawing with multi-sized tools</li>
						  <li>Sync whiteboard with connected users</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
			</li>

			<li class="left">
				<p class="proj-head">Wandering Soul</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/WanderingSoul">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<span>One of my few attempt to actually create a video game instead of just game engine. This is a 6 months project where I pushed my skill to the limit: map generator,
					  dynamic object placement, resource gathering and complicated combat. This was also the first major project where I attempted algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm for
					  pathfinding on tilemap) and AI (I created an action queues for each NPC and loop through what they should be doing and decide whether to add or remove actions from
					  the queue).
					  <ul>
						  <li>Heavy OOP, many polymorphism and inheritance for dynamic building</li>
						  <li>Dijkstra's Algorithm for Pathfinding and my own map generation algorithm</li>
						  <li>Many finished features: inventory, resource gathering, etc</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
				<img src="gfx/wander2.png">

			<li class="right">
				<p class="proj-head">Jackie's RPG Maker</p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/JackieRPGMaker">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<img src="gfx/rpgmaker.png">
				<span>This is the first big project that I worked on, spanning over summer of 2013 and into my junior year in high school. I tried to recreate Enterbrain's famous RPG
					  Maker VX and I was able to clone some (albeit worse) features. I was able to allow user to create very simple RPG without combats or diolog but have variables and
					  switch system for creating condition/events and users don't have to write a single line of code. On top of that they can customize the graphics and make their own
					  maps, as well as exporting/importing their own projects to put on other computers.
					  <ul>
						  <li>IO system, importing/exporting project files on Windows</li>
						  <li>Recursive saving for dynamic events system (similar to VX's)</li>
						  <li>Map editor, map animation, user-import-and-use custom graphics</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
