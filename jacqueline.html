		<h3>My Programming Experience</h3>
		<ul class="pastProjects">
			<li class="left">
				<p class="proj-head">Wayward Sail</p>
				<span>Wayward Sail is an in-progress ORPG that I and my fiance Kevin is working on. It is being built with Typescript for front end and Python/Flask for back end.
					  This is one of the most difficult project that I have worked on and forced me to step out of my comfort zone to play with concepts, languages and library that
					  I was not familiar with. Please refer to <a href="http://ordrstudio.com/">[My Homepage]</a> for list of features that we plan to implement.
					  <ul>
						  <li>HTML/CSS overlay with rendered graphic from PIXI</li>
						  <li>OAuth, Subscriber-Publisher model</li>
						  <li>Postgres, JSON Serialization</li>
						  <li>Graphic artist, content development</li>
					  </ul>
				</span>
				<img src="gfx/wayward2.png">
			</li>

			<li class="right">
				<p class="proj-head">CGen</p>
				<p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/codegenerator">[Hackathon Submission]</a></p>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/Jacquelinett/CodeGenerator">[GitHub Repository]</a></p>
				<img src="gfx/cgen.png">
				<span>This project is a 24 hours submission to HackPSU Spring 2017While CGen is a step down in term of programming difficulty, it's a project that I'm realy proud
					  to share because this is a project where I took charge and lead a 5 members team. I was the only one in my team that have a lot of programming experiences,
					  so I had to coach my team and divide the work and make sure that we get things done by milestone. Overall despite having only 4 hours of sleep. It was a really
					  fun experience and something I think worth sharing
					  <ul>
						  <li>Used GitHub for team collaboration and unit testing/integration</li>
						  <li>Agile/scrum to make sure the project was on time</li>
						  <li>Communication, pair programming and leadership</li>
					  </ul>
